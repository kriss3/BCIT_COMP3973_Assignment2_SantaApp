What you have not completed?
	- When Child details are viewed, look at the map. Sometimes the informaiton in the map refer to the prev recordd.
		refreshing the page will make it sync correctly. I am not sure why that happes. I am assuming it is the way I pass date between components (not really the way it should be but @Input() would not work - simply)

Any major challenges:
	- Server side finised in no time;
	- Angular 6 project in VS2017 'major pain'
		(much easier to create client app in VS_Code and servic side in VS2017);
	- Angula-maps library. When I tried to implement pure bing maps using their library it become a challenges
